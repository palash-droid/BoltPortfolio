# Resume Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Resume

1. **Replace the placeholder file**: Replace the `resume.pdf` file in this directory with your actual resume in PDF format.

2. **File naming**: Make sure the file is named exactly `resume.pdf` (case sensitive).

3. **File location**: The resume should be placed in the `public/` directory of your project.

## Resume Modal Features

The resume modal includes:
- **Preview**: Shows a summary of your skills and experience
- **Download**: Allows users to download the full PDF resume
- **Responsive design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark mode support**: Adapts to the current theme

## Customization

You can customize the resume preview content by editing the `ResumeModal.tsx` component in `src/components/ResumeModal.tsx`.

The preview includes:
- Professional summary
- Key skills
- Certifications

Update these sections to match your actual resume content.
